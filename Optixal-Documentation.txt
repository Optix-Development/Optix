Optix Documentation:

NOTE!
Not all Optixal features are listed here, as they are @admin functions.

Basic Syntax:
All functions use capital letters:

'Switch User' - As you can see, both words are in uppercase.

All login names are represented by numbers that directly relate to the line number that the username is stored on in 'users.txt'.
This is why there is no 'user 0'. The line number 0 does not exist. If you wish to secure your login, simply write your username on a higher line number.
For instance, '@SuperUltraAdmin usally uses the user_number 3, simply change its location to a higher state.

Most, if not all, functions will require some kind of data to inputted. Please give this data in the format requested, as the computer cannot determine different formats.
